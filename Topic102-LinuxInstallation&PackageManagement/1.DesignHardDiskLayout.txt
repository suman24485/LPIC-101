Main File System locations
####################################
Primary Locations
/ - Bottom of the directory tree,the root
/var - variable location,log files and dynamic content are often found here
/home - the users' home directory where personal files are stored
/boot - where the linux kernel and supporting files are stores
/opt - usd for optional sw,often used by 3rd party sw vendors.

Swap space
- Temp storage that acts like RAM
- when a %age of RAM is full,the kernel will move less used data to swap
- swap partition(most common setup)
- swap file(similar to page file on windows OS)
  - Much slower performance than using dedicated partition
- Sizing
  - Older rules of thumb raged from 1.5x to 2.0x the size of your available RAM

Partitions and Mount Points

Partitions

Ex:
/dev/sda - first harddrive

Mount Points
Taking a partition or disk and mounting it to a directory

Commnds
#mount
lists all the mounts on the system
more on xvda1
xvd - virtual drive under gen hypervisor

#lsblk
list out all the block devices
block devices are usually harddisks or the partition that takes more space

#fdisk -l /dev/xvda
to list out the partitions on a harddrive

#swapon --summary
/root/swap

Introduction to LVM(Logical Volume Manager)
####################################
Allows the creation of groups of disks or partitions that can be assembled into a single or multiple filesystems
  - can be used for nearly any mount point except /boot
  - Flexibility - allows for resizing of volumes
  - Snapshots - allows for point in time copies of your logical volume
Example
filesystem / /var swap /home
LogicalVolume lv_root lv_var lv_swap lv_home
VolumeGroup vg_base
PhysicalVolume /dev/sda /dev/sdb /dev/sdc

Sampling of LVM commands
#pvs
lists out the physical volumes in an LVM Group

#vgs
lists out the volume groups within an LVM group

#lvs
lists out the logical volume groups within an LVM group
