Virtualization and Containers

Virtual Machine
  - Emulation of a specific computer system type
  - Operate based on the arch and functions of a real computer and its implementation
  can involve specialized hw,sw or both
  - Virtualization sw allows us to setup on OS within another:
        - both share same physical hw(n/wcards,ram,hdd)
        - VM is isolated from that hw and has to communicate with it through hypervisor
        - Hypervisor examples
              - KVM
              - QEMU
              - VMWare
              - Xen
              - VirtualBox

Virtual Machine Basics
Two types of virtualization
- Full Virtualization

- Para Virtualization
VMs can be cloned or turned into templates to repadily deploy new systems
    - Note that you may need to change a lnx system's D-Bus machine ID
    - dbus-uuidgen - ensures that each running kernel interacts with a suystem that has a unique ID

VMs in the cloud
- cloud-init is typically iused to insure that user data is totally new like
    - Create new ssh keys
    - sets the system default ocale
    - sets the systems hostname
    - setsup mount points
