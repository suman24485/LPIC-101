Legacy GRUB
###############################
Grand Unified Boot Loader on MBR (Master Boot Record)
MBR is first 512 bytes

Bios checks everthing and if everything all hw is good to go
Stage 1
BIOS locates a boot loader
boot loader has a small image boot.img on MBR which is first 512 bytes
Stage 1.5
boot.img look for core.img
whole purpose of bootimg is to get the core.img loaded
Stage 2
core.img pur is to locate actual boot partition of the system
/boot/grub
grub.conf or menu.lst (redhatdistro/debdistro)
device.map - indicates which  drive contains the actual kernel and the OS that needs to be booted

check grub.conf file
contains the details of the list of linux kernels available

Installing GRUB
grub-install [device]
device can be /dev/sda or /dev/hd0 or '(hd0)'
#grub
grub> find /grub/stage1

grub cmds
#grub
grub> help
grub> find /grub/stage1

GRUB2
######
Difference b/w MBR and GPT

MBR
- used with legacy grub supported only 26total partitions
- each partition size limited to 2TB

Due to the above constraints we now have GPT

GPT(GUID Partition Table)
- a single GPT disk supports 128 artitions
- partition size up in ZB
- Needs UEFI(Unified Extensible Firmaware Interface) to boot:
    - Replacement fro traditional BIOS,can act in legacy BIOS mode
    - Requires 64bit OS
    - prevents unauthorized OS from booting on the system

GRUB2 on GPT with UEFI

UEFI BIOS
Stage 1
UEFI BIOS locates MBR same as legacy GRUB which contains boot.img
GPT Header, Partition Entry Array(large listing of partitions)

Stage 1.5
- core.img looks for /boot/efi partition
- this is known as efi system partition or ESP(only vfat or FAT32)

Stage 2
ls /boot/grub2
grubenv
themes

grub2 cmds
on redhatdistro grub2-<cmd>
on debdistro grub-<cmd>
#grub2-editenv list
#cat /etc/default/grub
#vim /etc/default/grub
#grub2-mkconfig
#less /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
#ls /etc/grub.d

GRUB LEGACY

On Centos
[A]key - append options to the kernel boot line

[C]key - opens up the GRUB cmd line

[ESC]key - escapes out of any GRUB menu

On Ubuntu
[E]key - used to edit a GRUB menu item

Ctrl+x or F10 - boots a selection or modified line
