Manage Shared Libraries

Shared Library
  - Files containing functionality that other applications can use
  - These files end in a .so extension - for "shared object"
  - Found at belwo locations
      - /lib
      - /usr/lib(32bitsystems) and /usr/lib64
      - /usr/local/lib
      - /usr/share
  - Two types of library files
      - Dynamic(ends in .so) => shared among multiple apps
      - Statically linked(ends in .a) => compiled for apps that need to make sure that it calls the same version.
cmds
#ldd - prints out the so dependencies
#ldconfig - configures dynamic linker runtime bindings, creates a cache based on library directories and can show you what is currently cached
#cat /etc/ld.so.conf
conf. files that points to directories and other config files that hold refs to library directory location

Env variable
