Pseudo Filesystem
##################
- Regular File system is a method of laying out files and folders
 on a physical disk
- exists only on RAM and will be available only when system is running
- Two pseudo filesystems of interest
    - /proc
      #cd /proc
      #ls
      - contains all the current running processes (PID) represented by a directory
      - also contains some more info like cpuinfo,meminfo,uptime,version etc.,
      #cat cpuinfo
      #cd 1/ - contains info about this particular process
      #ls
      #cat cmdline

    - /sys
      contains the info about the devices and the kernel
      #cd /sys
      #ls
      #cd fs - contains info abt the filesystems on the machine
      #ls
      #cd xfs
      #cd xvda1/
      error log stats
      #cd stats
      #ls
      stats stats_clear
      #cat stats

Working with Kernel Modules
####################################
Linux Kernel
- Core Framework of the OS
- Provides a way for the rest of the system to operate with h/w, memory, networking and itself
- it is monolithic
    - handles all mem mgmt and h/w device interactions
    - extra functionality can be loaded and unloaded dynamically through kernel modules
    - ensures the system will not need to be rebooted into a different kernel image for added functionality
- many third party kernl modules are device drivers

uname
#uname
Linux
#uname -m
bitrate
#uname -rm
kernel release version along with machine type(bitrate)
#uname -a
shows everything abt the machine

modules
#lsmod (list modules)
Module    Size    Used by

#modinfo <modulename>

modprobe to load/unload particular module)
#modprobe -r <modulename> (removes module)
#modprobe <modulename> (loads module)

Investigating Hardware
####################################
Linux Device Mgmt
udev - device manager for linux kernel links information on

New Hardware is attached to system
Udev(detects the h/w and sends info to /dev(pseudo filesystem) through Databus service)
Udev---- D-Bus ----> /dev <---D-Bus---> #lsblk(user command)

#ls /dev - contains info abt the processorsinfo, mem,network info,harddrive,tty locations
#ls /dev/cpu - contains  the info about the no.of cores
#ls /dev/cpu/0/
#ls /dev/dri - video drivers

Attach a USB and run the below commands
#ls /dev/
sda sda1 => externally attached harddrive

lspci - list out all the pci devices attached to our computer
devices connected to the PCI buses
#lspci
#lspci -k (to list out which part of hw is using the which modules)
#lspci -v (each individual hardware is capable of)

lsusb - shows list of USB devices attached
#lsusb
#lsusb -v
#lsusb -t (to show which usb device is attached to which usb controller)

lscpu - details about the cpu liike architecture etc
#lscpu

lsblk - to see which harddisk are attached to the system
#lsblk
#lsblk -f
