Introduction to RegEx

Similar to File globbing within bash

. - represents a single character
$ grep g.m passwd
$ grep s..t passwd
$ grep 100. passwd

^ - search the beginning of the line
$ grep ^rpc passwd

$ - search the end of line
$ grep bash$ passwd

[abc] - search for specified characters
$ grep [v] passwd
$ grep -i [v] passwd (case insensitive)
$ grep [Vv] passwd
$ grep ^[Aa].[Aa] passwd

[^abc] - search for other characters, but not these
$ grep ^[Aa].[Aa][^h] passwd

* - matches zero or more of the preceding characters or expressions
$ grep var* passwd

man 7 regex

Using Regex Tools

sed - stream editor cmd can operate on files using regex
$ cat passwd | sed -n '/nologin$/p' - prints lines that ends with nologin
$ cat passwd | sed '/nologin$/d' - deletes the lines that ends with nologin and prints the remainaing output

egrep - cmd that searches a specified file line by line returning lines that contain a pattern matching a given regular expression
Equivallent to grep -E
$ egrep 'bash$' passwd
prints the lines that ends with bash
$ egrep -c 'bash$' passwd
prints the no.of lines that end with bash
$ egrep '^rpc|nologin$' passwd
prints the lines that start with rpc and lines that ends with nologin

fgrep - searches based on the strings rather than the patterns.Also uses fileglobbing instead of regex
Equivalent to grep -F
$ fgrep -f strings passwd
strings - a file that has patterns to search for
$ cat strings
root
apache
/home
$ fgrep -f strings passwd*
