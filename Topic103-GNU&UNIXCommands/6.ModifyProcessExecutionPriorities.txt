Understanding and Changing Process Priorities

Process Priorities

- All processes need to use CPU time
- Priority assignment dictates how much time CPU grants the process
- Process priority(nice level) ranges from :
    - -20 (highest priority)
    - 19(lowest)
    - 0 is the default for most processes
- only root can lower the nice value of a process

cmds to modify the nice levels

nice - cmd used to define a new nice level before an application is started
$ ps -o pid,nice,cmd,user
PID   NI    CMD     USER

$ watch -n 3 date &
$ ps -o pid,nice,cmd,user
$ kill -9 pid
$ nice -n 5 watch -n 3 date &
$ ps -o pid,nice,cmd,user

renice - cmd used to change the nice level of an app that is already running
$ sudo renice -n -1 <pid of the above watch cmd>
$ top
