Reviewing the State of the system
A process is set of instructions loaded into memory
these come from a program that is running
  mem context
  priority
  environment
PID 1 is the parent process

$ ps -eH | less
presents the process heirarchy
systemd

  node
    login

    login
      bash
        ps
        less

$ ps (shows just the processes currently runing on the current shell)

$ sudo yum install man-pages
$ man 7 signal
search for /Standard signals
SIGHUP  1
SIGINT  2
SIGKILL 9
SIGTERM 15

$ pgrep httpd
$ sudo kill <PID>
$ kill -l
$ sudo kill -9 <PID>
$ sudo pkill httpd
$ pgrep -a httpd
$ pkill -x httpd

Keep a Process Running even after the logout

$ sudo killall httpd
$ sudo killall -s 9 httpd

$ exit (to terminate the screen session)

tmux - similar to screen
$ tmux
$ ssh
$ ls
